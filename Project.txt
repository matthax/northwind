NorthWind Project

This project will test and include all the technoliges we have covered in class (HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX etc). You are tasked to create a website for NorthWind. NorthWind is a distributor and they have a database, but they do not have an effective method of viewing, editing, maintaining etc. this data. They want you to create a application/website where customers can log-in and order products from. 

1) Create a log in page for Customers. 
	A) Customer information is kept in the "customers" table. 
		-Customer log-in username will be ID (this is only an integer so keep this in mind) and password will default to 'red123'.
	B) After a customer has logged in take them to their respective page. Customers who have ordered from Northwind before should be able to see their past ordered items. 
	C) create a sign-up page for new customers (since there is no password field this will still defualt to red123)
		-This data should be saved in the customers table (users should be able to come in and log-in after signing up)

2) Create an items page for customers. They need a way to search for items in Northwinds inventory to list out Northwinds items.
	A) customers should be able to put items in cart and later check out.  
	b) have a method where users can get more information about the selected item. From here adding to cart.  

3) Create a shopping cart where users can check out and process their order. 
	-when a user checks out they should be able to then see their orders (from Step 1).
		-History of orders should be updated.
